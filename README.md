# Galaxy::TestSupport

This GEM simply provides some diagnostic tools that I think will be useful when running tests.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'galaxy-test_support', :git => "git@github.com:demandchain/galaxy-test_support.git"

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

### Development

You'll probably save yourself a lot of pain during development if you change the Gemfile line to this:

    gem 'galaxy-test_support', :path => '../galaxy-test_support'
